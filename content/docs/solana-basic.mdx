## üöÄ Skills to Master

### What Can You Build with Solana?

Solana enables developers to build a wide range of decentralized applications:

- **DeFi Protocols**: DEXs, lending platforms, yield farming
- **NFT Marketplaces**: Digital art, gaming assets, collectibles
- **Gaming**: Play-to-earn games, virtual worlds
- **Social Platforms**: Decentralized social networks
- **Supply Chain**: Transparent tracking and verification
- **Identity Systems**: Self-sovereign identity solutions

### Solana as Cloud Computing

#### Validator Network

- **Validators**: Nodes that process transactions and maintain the network
- **Consensus**: Proof of History (PoH) + Proof of Stake (PoS)
- **Network Architecture**: Global distributed network of computers

#### Blockchain Basics

- **Blocks**: Groups of transactions processed together
- **Chain**: Sequential linking of blocks with cryptographic proofs
- **Decentralization**: No single point of failure or control

#### Cryptographic Fundamentals

- **Private Key**: Secret key for signing transactions (keep secure!)
- **Public Key**: Address derived from private key (shareable)
- **Keypair**: The combination of private and public keys

#### Block Production Process

1. **Transaction Submission**: Users submit transactions to the network
2. **Validation**: Validators verify transaction validity
3. **Block Creation**: Valid transactions are grouped into blocks
4. **Consensus**: Network agrees on block order using PoH
5. **Finalization**: Block is added to the blockchain

### Understanding Solana Fundamentals

#### Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)

- **Definition**: Deterministic addresses derived from program ID and seeds
- **Purpose**: Store program state and data on-chain
- **Uniqueness**: Guaranteed to be unique within a program's address space
- **Usage**: Accounts, program state, cross-program invocation

#### Transactions

- **Structure**: Instructions, accounts, recent blockhash, signatures
- **Types**: Transfer, program invocation, account creation
- **Fees**: Small fees paid in SOL for network processing
- **Confirmation**: Multiple confirmations ensure finality

### Understanding Wallets

#### Wallet Components

- **Keypair Management**: Secure storage of private keys
- **Address Generation**: Deriving public addresses from private keys
- **Transaction Signing**: Cryptographic proof of ownership
- **Balance Tracking**: Monitoring SOL and token balances

#### Wallet Types

- **Software Wallets**: Phantom, Solflare, Backpack
- **Hardware Wallets**: Ledger, Trezor
- **Custodial Wallets**: Exchange-managed wallets
- **Non-custodial Wallets**: User-controlled private keys
